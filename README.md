# Key Club Mobile App
Unofficial Key Club App created with Xamarin

This repository hosts the Android and iOS projects for the unofficial key club app. Any other projects (windows phone, etc.) are empty/nonworking and should either be implemented or deleted. Further development on the app is to coincide with the goals outlined here.

# To do
- [ ] Update Project
- [ ] Change club organization to organization by zone
- [ ] Update Calendar UI
- [ ] Redesign new event UI
- [ ] Automatic Refresh after uploading Ann/Event
- [ ] Update Branding
- [ ] Update read.md with feature list, proper app description

Any additional points for consideration should be proposed through a comment or pull request of an updated README.md.
