# Key-Club-Mobile-App
Unofficial Key Club App created with Xamarin

This repository hosts the Android and iOS projects for the unofficial key club app. Any other projects (windows phone, etc.) are empty/nonworking and should either be implemented or deleted. Further development on the app is to coincide with the goals outlined here.

Todo:
- Upgrade project to VS2017 and same for its dependencies/packages
- Replace branding
- Change club organization to zone organization
- Login Verification

Any additional points for consideration should be proposed through a comment or pull request of an updated README.md.
